# Install
You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. Simply download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and go through the installation steps.

Once Node.js is installed, open your command prompt or terminal and run `npm i gatsby-cli`. This installs [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) command line tools. 

Then **navigate into this project folder**. There, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

Next to setup the database we need to install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/).
